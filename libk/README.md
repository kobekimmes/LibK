**Welcome to libk!**

This project is to experiment with low-level syscalls and to get more practice writing x86_64 assembly (even though these functions are being written C utilizing asm() in-line functionality)

This is being written on my Mac with an Intel CPU (x86_64 instruction set)

This project is also going to help familiarize myself with Docker and containerization since I am more comfortable with Linux architecture.
